[Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com) is a game jam in which participants are required to develop a game in 48 hours, using a given theme. My friend Matt and decided to participate in Ludum Dare 31 this past weekend. The theme this time around was *Entire Game on One Screen*.

After about an hour of brainstorming on Friday night, we came up with the idea for our game *Enter the Murderdome*. From Friday night to Sunday afternoon we worked on the game, Matt doing the art and sound and me doing the programming. In the end, I think the result was a super fun game with a lot of polish which you can play using the link below.

Thanks for checking out our game, and I hope you enjoy it.
