There is a recent trend in the development community of creating curated lists of resources for various frameworks, languages, and tools. Some examples of these lists include [Awesome Ruby](https://github.com/markets/awesome-ruby) and [Awesome Django](https://github.com/rosarior/awesome-django). The advantage of these lists being hosted on GitHub is that other users can contribute additions and changes to be included.

I recently created [Awesome Unity](https://github.com/RyanNielson/awesome-unity) in the hopes of creating the defacto list of Unity assets, projects, and resources. It's open to pull requests on GitHub, which allows anyone to submit additions or changes if they wish. With enough contributions, I think this list could become a great resource for new and experienced users alike.
